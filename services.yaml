reset_model:
  name: Reset thermal model
  description: >
    Reset the thermal simulation to a known state. All fields are optional and can
    be combined freely. Use a preset for named starting conditions, explicit temperature
    fields for arbitrary states, or omit everything to reset to the configured
    initial_temperature with all nodes at the same value.

      description: >
        Named starting condition. Any explicit temperature field takes priority over
        the corresponding preset value.
        cold_start: all nodes at current external temperature (heating off for days).
        overnight: room 16 C, fabric 14 C - heating off overnight in a reasonably insulated house.
        room_temperature: room 18 C, fabric 17 C - typical occupied room after sustained heating.

    t_room:
      name: Room temperature
      description: >
        Set room/air node to an arbitrary temperature (degrees C). Takes priority over preset.
        Use alone to simulate any starting condition - fabric and radiator will default
        to the same value (fully equilibrated). Example: 21.5 to test cooling behaviour
        from a warm room.

    t_fabric:
      name: Fabric temperature
      description: >
        Set building fabric temperature (degrees C) independently of the air node. Applies to
        R2C2 models only; ignored by Simple and plain Radiator models. Defaults to t_room
        if not specified. Set lower than t_room to simulate fabric that has not yet caught
        up with a recently heated room; set equal for a fully equilibrated start.

      description: >
        Set radiator water temperature (degrees C). Applies to radiator models only; ignored by
        Simple and R2C2 models. Defaults to t_room (cold radiator) if not specified.
        Set to flow_temperature to simulate a hot radiator at the start of a heating period.
